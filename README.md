# filescrape
Some scripts to help scrape and files out of backups

right now one script steps over directories and makes a lit of files with a particular extention

another script generates an html doc that shows an image and the path/file to the associated file

another is just the stub of a function to find the width to set an image to maintain aspect ratio when the height is set to an arbitrary number
